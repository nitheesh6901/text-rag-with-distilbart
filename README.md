# text-rag-with-distilbart
 DistilBART RAG Pipeline This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using DistilBART — a lightweight transformer model — combined with FAISS for efficient vector-based retrieval. It retrieves relevant text chunks from a document store and generates concise, context-aware answers.
